"The hard work is continuing at Carrington as Erik ten Hag analyses his Manchester United players and prepares a squad for Tour 2022.
Our new manager began his tenure at the training ground on Monday morning and has notably been arriving early each day - and leaving late - to ensure everything is meticulously prepared for his group.
With a keen eye for detail, Ten Hag plays an active role in all sessions alongside his assistants Mitchell van der Gaag and Steve McClaren.Erik is working with a group that comprises of established senior players like David De Gea, Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho.
They are mixed with fledgling Academy players such as Alvaro Fernandez, Will Fish, Zidane Iqbal, Charlie Savage and Alejandro Garnacho, to name a few. 
The outdoor session on Thursday was intense and enjoyable for all involved, mixing plenty of ball work with hard running to build sharpness.
See who is pictured in the latest training session via the gallery below…"

"As the curtain closed on the 2021/22 season, Manchester United invited one of our proud sponsors, Chivas Regal, to take part in a pitch day at Old Trafford.
A UK XI played against a World XI on the hallowed turf, and we caught up with Avelino after his time on the pitch.
The British rapper has been a proud fan of the Reds for pretty much his entire life and has even featured in some of our previous kit launches. Hence we chatted all things United, but started our interview by asking him this...
How does it feel to play at Old Trafford?
“It’s brilliant, man. I’m a die-hard United fan. Aside from my time being consumed entirely by music, the other hour is purely football. I’ve grown up on United, so when I look back on my life, most of my best memories will be related to football and this club. So to play here again, it’s a dream.”
How was the game?“An unbelievable occasion for a man like myself, especially as a United fan. In terms of football, it wasn’t my best performance, but I scored at Old Trafford so I can’t argue with that. No complaints.”"

"What a difference a few weeks makes.
It's barely a month since last season finished, but how nice it was to see Manchester United's first-team squad rocking up at Carrington for the start of pre-season 2022/23.
The less said about 2021/22 the better, but that campaign already feels 2,000 light years away. Erik ten Hag's arrival has laced the place with a new optimism, and everyone at the club is looking forward with positivity.
You could see that on many of the pictures shared on Monday (27 June). There was freshness in the players' faces and a relaxedness to their dispositions. And you suspect that's not just because of the new training kit, or the few weeks' holiday they've just enjoyed.
Ten Hag's arrival signals a new start. For everyone. Over the coming weeks, the Dutchman will be paying close attention to each player and every little detail he can spot. And who knows what that could mean for the make-up of the squad?
Could it even make for some quite radical changes?
Take Anthony Martial, for example. The Frenchman's smiling demeanour on day one at Carrington embodied the new-found, upbeat atmosphere, and no wonder.
The last couple of years have been difficult for the striker. Since a brilliant 2019/20 season, when he scored 23 goals and was named the Players' Player of the Year, he has suffered injury issues and lost his place. He spent the second half of 2021/22 at Sevilla, where injuries once again beset him.
But there's a big opportunity for Martial under ten Hag. United's leading striker last year was Cristiano Ronaldo, who netted 24 goals, but the Portuguese legend is 37 years old and probably unlikely to play every game.
With Edinson Cavani gone, Martial has a clear pathway to first-team minutes and chances to impress, if he can excite Ten Hag during pre-season. He'll be working with a new manager that has a strong track record when it comes to revitalising players. Think about Sebastien Haller, who struggled at West Ham United before exploding into life under Ten Hag at Ajax.
A determined, injury-free Martial can be a huge boost to United, despite the difficulties of the last couple of seasons."
